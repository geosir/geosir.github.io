        Today, it still holds that promise in preparing students to be great in the modern world. But it has lost that certain vigor which made the early years at IMSA such an exciting new opportunity. The pioneering spirit has gone, leaving a stagnant and mundane husk of what it used to be.<br /><br />

        Yet, things are beginning to look up. With great changes happening throughout the school, from the construction of new classrooms and lounges in the main building, to the review and improvement of academic courses, this is our chance to push for a progressive agenda to jumpstart the Academy.<br /><br />

        The biggest change begins right here at home—our residential halls. By reinvigorating our community, through programs like the ones described below, we&#39;ll not only revitalize the Academy, but we&#39;ll also find a spark of optimism within ourselves.</p>

Yet, it&#39;s hard to get details about the goals and progress of these projects. Being informed about these is important, since these affect everyone&#39;s IMSA experience. They also work best when everyone gets involved in the design and feedback process. It&#39;s about time StudCo became better at being transparent.<br /><br />

                                                                                        <li>Design a reworked website layout, featuring a news feed on the homepage and easily accessible project pages. Active projects will be featured on the homepage as well.</li>
                                                                                </ul>

We all get stressed when the going gets tough, but sometimes, something terrible happens: we become fatigued, tired of life. There are times when we all lose the will to do anything, and most of the time, this is normal. But if this happens chronically, it could lead to depression. It&#39;s important that StudCo create more programs and mental health initiatives to help students through these difficult times—and while we&#39;re at it, maybe help everyone rediscover the passion that inspired them to come to IMSA.<br /><br />

                                                                                        <li>Run a campaign using posters, videos, and events to showcase what can be done at IMSA, as well as provide information about opportunities at IMSA.</li>

This could mean getting better lighting, doing some cleanup of facilities, creating new art for the school, among other aesthetic renovations.</li>
                                                                                </ul>
