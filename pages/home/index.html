    <h1>Hi! I'm George.</h1>
    <p>
        I’m a guy who likes to do things.

        As a freshman at Harvard College, I am preparing myself to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing

        I've done research at UIC and Fermilab, and written software for institutions like the Illinois Math and Science
        Academy and the University of Chicago.
