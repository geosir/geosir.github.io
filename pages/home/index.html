				Hi there! I'm George Moe. I like to do things. What kinds of things? <a href="#projects">All sorts of things!</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				From tinkering, to reading, to making music, to crafting movies...from thinking, to writing, to traveling, to BBQing, to much, much more, I try my best to be an active part of the world around me. Check out my <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a> for a log of the neat projects I've worked on!
			</p>
			<p>
				I hope that this website will serve as my way to share what I've learned with the world. It's still under construction, but soon this will be the home for my project pages, blog entries, and more! Enjoy!
			</p>
