    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>
        My name is George Moe. I’m a guy who likes to do things.

        From tinkering to thinking to BBQing, I try my best to be an active part of this world. Check out my <a
            href="#projects">projects</a> page to see some of my exciting explorations!

        As a freshman at Harvard College, I am working to apply myself to solve real problems facing humanity. I’ve done
        research at UIC and Fermilab, and written software for institutions like the Illinois Mathematics and Science
        Academy and the University of Chicago. I’d love to discuss my experiences, so if you’re interested, please <a
            href="#connect">contact me</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website is my way to share what I’ve learned with the world. Poke around and see what you can find!
        Maybe you’ll even discover a <a href="#projects/clickme">game</a> or <a href="https://freshestme.me">two</a>. In
        the end, I hope you find this site to be useful and enjoyable.
