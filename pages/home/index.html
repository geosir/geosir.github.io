                My name is <b>George Moe</b>. I'm a person who does things&mdash;all sorts of things in all the different areas in life!
                From inventing the next big thing, to dabbling in music, to studying emergent sciences, participating in community
                service projects, writing poetry and philosophical musings, and many more, I strive to become the best open-minded world-citizen as I can be. Some of things I've done can be found in my <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a>.
                <br /><br />
                As a high-school junior at the Illinois Math and Science Academy, I take our motto, "advance the human
                condition," to heart. I am always looking for new things to learn and new
                opportunities to explore so that one day, I can give something great to this world.
                <br /><br />
                So have a peek at what I busy myself with. You can see some of my current projects on <a href="#projects">my projects page</a>.
