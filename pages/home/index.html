                My name is George Moe. I like to do things.

                Whether it's tinkering, reading, making music, producing movies, philosophizing, storytelling,
                traveling, BBQing, or much more, I try my best to be an active part of the world around me. Check out my
                <a href="#projects">projects</a> page for a portfolio of my explorations!

                I am a highschool senior at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, where I've taken our
                mission statement to heart: "...advance the human condition." Accordingly, I've tried my best to apply
                myself to the real, working world, from doing research at UIC and Fermilab to writing software and
                building websites for institutions like IMSA and the University of Chicago.

                This website is meant to be my way to share what I've learned with the world. It's still
                under construction, but ultimately it'll be home to my project pages, resume, fun things, blog posts,
                and more! I hope you find this site useful and enjoyable.
