                <p>Thank you for using one of my projects!</p>

                <p>Please understand that my projects are merely personal hobby projects.
                    They should be considered as informal, free-to-use, non-commercial
                    services that are provided as-is with no warranty.</p>

                <hr/>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>

                <p>I will personally work to the best of my ability to protect your data.
                    But please do not expect industry-standard security, as there projects
                    are funded by my own personal resources and developed in my own free
                    time. Please do not input highly-sensitive data, such as passwords,
                    bank account numbers, personal identification numbers, etc. into any
                    of my projects, as I cannot gurantee that they will be transmitted or
                    stored securely. Although I have implemented many common security
                    protocols, anything can happen, so proceed at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>

                <h3>Regarding Page Analytics</h3>

                <p>I use Google Analytics to collect general anonymous visitor statistics
                    on my project webpages. The types of data collected includes page-
                    views, page events (like object clicks and views), and other forms of
                    data collected by default by Google Analytics.</p>

                <p>Note that Google Analytics uses cookies to help gather visitor data.
                    If this practice concerns you, you can disable cookies or enter a
                    private-browsing mode on your web browser. You can also discontinue
                    use of my projects.</p>

                <h3>Regarding Service Data</h3>

                <p>Some projects recieve data that you enter as part of the service they
                    provide (like Task data in QuestTracker, event data on WhatDo,
                    conversation data with Ovbot projects, and account data).
                    Understand that when you transmit data to the service, that data may
                    be received by my server, interpreted, and stored in the course of
                    providing the service. Key features of the service would not be possible
                    without such collection, interpretation, and storage.</p>

                <p>I have included informational messages where it might not be obvious
                    that your data is being received and collected. An example of this
                    is visible at the bottom of the Mark Ovbot page.</p>

                <hr/>

                <h2>Use of Data</h2>

                <h3>For Service</h3>

                <p>Data that is collected and/or stored by my projects will definitely be
                    used to provide the service intended by the project. You implicitly
                    consent to such use and the services offered by the project by using
                    the project. (Because otherwise why would you use the project??)</p>

                <h3>For Development</h3>

                <p>I am always looking to improve my projects, so I may use data that is
                    collected and stored by my projects to debug and improve existing
                    projects, and develop future projects. Please understand this to be
                    a part of the informal private nature of my projects. If you do not
                    consent to this practice, please immediately stop using my projects.</p>

                <h3>Not for Profit</h3>

                <p>I will NEVER disclose your data to any external person or entity for
                    any commercial reason. This means that I will not sell your data to any data-
                    gathering corporation, interested individual, etc.</p>

                <h3>For Legal Reasons</h3>

                <p>The only case that I may disclose your data to anyone other than my-
                    self or personnel that are primarily involved in my projects is if
                    an official agent of the United States government has valid legal
                    justification to obtain that data. I will work diligently and
                    carefully in this event to only provide the data that is legally
                    required, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

                <hr/>

                <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

                <p>By continuing to use my projects, you agree to the terms of this
                    privacy policy. If you do not agree, please immediately stop using
                    by projects.</p>

                <p>Thank you! If you have any questions or concerns, you may contact
                    me at <a href="mailto:george@george.moe">george@george.moe</a>.</p>
