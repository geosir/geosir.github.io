            <p>You may have noticed that the layout of this website is quite interesting!</p>
            <p>That's because it's an experiment to create a more organic way to browse digital content.</p>
            <p>I call this layout <b>Stroll</b>, and if it is successful, I hope to release it as an open-source
                framework.</p>
