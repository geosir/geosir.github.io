        satellites pass overhead and transmit a live camera view of the ground below them. Using a cheap RTL-SDR
        dongle and a homemade antenna,
        I've been experimenting with receiving and decoding these signals to get pictures...from SPACE!</p>

        <p>My experiments with Software Defined Radio (SDR) and RTL-SDR started a couple of years ago after I purchased
            dongle off Amazon for about $10. Initially, I only dabbled in receiving terrestrial radio, particularly
            weather radio broadcasts
            and public police broadcasts. Soon though, I learned that it is possible to receive satellite
            transmissions with a specialized antenna.</p>
        <p>In particular, NOAA POES satellites broacast analog low-resolution scans of the ground below them using
            the Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) protocol. These signals are broadcast at around 137MHz
            (depending on the particular satellite) using a right-hand circularly polarized FM carrier signal.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The first antenna I made for receiving NOAA APT signals was a simple 137MHz dipole antenna I built following
            <a
                    href="http://lna4all.blogspot.com/2017/02/diy-137-mhz-wx-sat-v-dipole-antenna.html">this guide</a>.
            While it was easy to build and was able to sucessfully receive APT signals, the gain was not very
            good and there were a number of blind spots where the radio signal faded out completely.
        </p>
        <p>In pursuit of better reception, I then built a (rather makeshift) right-hand circularly polarized 137MHz
            Quadrifilar Helical (QFH) antenna following <a
                    href="http://www.instructables.com/id/NOAA-Satellite-Signals-with-a-PVC-QFH-Antenna-and-/">this
                guide</a>. Although this antenna was harder to construct and required more particular wiring, it is
            specifically attuned to the APT signals and resulted in much clearer reception.
        </p>
        <p>Close-ups of the two antennas can be seen below:</p>

        <p>With the hardware out of the way, it was all a matter of finding the right sofware to decode the APT signals
            into
            images. Since I'm on Linux, I chose to use GQRX to drive the RTL-SDR dongle and read the radio signals into
            sound. I also installed GPredict to track the satellites and account for frequecy shift caused by the
            Doppler Effect. Finally, I used WXtoImg to translate the sound from my sound card into NOAA satellite
            images.</p>
        <p>Luckily, since RTL-SDR is a Software Defined Radio, it's laughingly easy to automate timing, tracking, and
            capture of the satellites and their data. Using a couple of homebrew python scripts (some more slapdash
            than others), I set up a system to track the nearest NOAA satellite, timestamp the images generated by
            WXtoImg, and upload them onto this website so that they can be seen below.</p>
