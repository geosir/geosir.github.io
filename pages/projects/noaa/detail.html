                satellites pass overhead and transmit a live camera view of the ground below them. Using a cheap RTL-SDR
                dongle and a homemade antenna,
                I've been experimenting with receiving and decoding these signals to get pictures...from SPACE!</p>

            <p class="caption">The RTL-SDR dongle and antenna patch-in.</p>
            <p>My experiments with Software Defined Radio (SDR) and RTL-SDR started a couple of years ago after I
                purchased
                dongle off Amazon for about $10. Initially, I only dabbled in receiving terrestrial radio, particularly
                weather radio broadcasts
                and public police broadcasts. Soon though, I learned that it is possible to receive satellite
                transmissions with a specialized antenna.</p>
            <p>In particular, NOAA POES satellites broacast analog low-resolution scans of the ground below them using
                the Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) protocol. These signals are broadcast at around 137MHz
                (depending on the particular satellite) using a right-hand circularly polarized FM carrier signal.</p>

            <p class="caption">Radio Base: George, featuring the dipole antenna (left) and QFH antenna (right).</p>

            <p>The first antenna I made for receiving NOAA APT signals was a simple 137MHz dipole antenna I built
                following
                <a
                        href="http://lna4all.blogspot.com/2017/02/diy-137-mhz-wx-sat-v-dipole-antenna.html">this
                    guide</a>.
                While it was easy to build and was able to sucessfully receive APT signals, the gain was not very
                good and there were a number of blind spots where the radio signal faded out completely.
            </p>
            <p>In pursuit of better reception, I then built a (rather makeshift) right-hand circularly polarized 137MHz
                Quadrifilar Helical (QFH) antenna following <a
                        href="http://www.instructables.com/id/NOAA-Satellite-Signals-with-a-PVC-QFH-Antenna-and-/">this
                    guide</a>. Although this antenna was harder to construct and required more particular wiring, it is
                specifically attuned to the APT signals and resulted in much clearer reception.
            </p>
            <p>Close-ups of the two antennas can be seen below:</p>

            <p class="caption">The dipole antenna, in all its glory. It took way too long to find and install all those

            <p class="caption">The satellite signals are interpreted by GQRX and WXtoImg.</p>

            <p>With the hardware out of the way, it was all a matter of finding the right sofware to decode the APT
                signals
                into
                images. Since I'm on Linux, I chose to use GQRX to drive the RTL-SDR dongle and read the radio signals
                into
                sound. I also installed GPredict to track the satellites and account for frequecy shift caused by the
                Doppler Effect. Finally, I used WXtoImg to translate the sound from my sound card into NOAA satellite
                images.</p>
            <p>Luckily, since RTL-SDR is a Software Defined Radio, it's laughingly easy to automate timing, tracking,
                and
                capture of the satellites and their data. Using a couple of homebrew python scripts (some more slapdash
                than others), I set up a system to track the nearest NOAA satellite, timestamp the images generated by
                WXtoImg, and archive them for future analysis. I've picked some of the clearest and most interesting
                downlinks
                to share below.</p>
