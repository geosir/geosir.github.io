    <p>Club Hub is a framework designed to centralize and organize posters and event information into an
        easy-to-understand format, all through the magic automation of programming. It features a main event listing, an
        event reminder service, as well as a slideshow for digital displays.
    </p>
    <p>Club Hub got its start at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. The story goes like this:</p>
    <p>As informative as it is, Students-l is widely regarded as spammy and annoying. At the same time, it's rather
        difficult to keep up IMSA Virtual Campus. Indeed, scrolling through an endless torrent of emails every day in
        addition to having to dedicate time to sort through a facebook page can be exhausting. With similar problems in
        a host of other channels, the result is a heavily fragmented communications scene on campus--it can be very
        difficult to get a clear idea of what's going on at IMSA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Club Hub seeks to fix this by providing a location where you can visually grasp the order of events at IMSA. The
        idea is that if we use posters as "icons" for each event and arrange them in an intuitive way, it'll be easy to
        literally see what's happening at the academy. Thus our vision: to make it easy to see What the Next Big Thing
        at IMSA is.</p>

        <p class="section-label"><b>August 21, 2016</b></p>
        <h3>Club Hub v3.0.0 arrives with a total makeover!</h3>
        <p>This version of Club Hub brings with it a tastefully redesigned and animated slideshow, which is now called
            Club Hub LIVE. To accompany this UX change, there is also now an Admin panel, allowing easy review and
            editing of posters with a click of button. Finally, these updates are thanks to a backend migration to
            Django (from pure JS and Google App Script), allowing for richer features and easy of deployment (including
            a Dockerfile!).</p>
        <p>Organizationally, Club Hub is now an independent entity that is managed by <a href="https://tsociety.org">Tech
            Society</a> and IMSA Student Life, having formerly been filed under Student Council.</p>

        <h3>Club Hub v2.5.0 is finally here!</h3>
        <p>Club Hub is now ready for use at IMSA--all the necessary infrastrucure has been taken care of, and
            the new
            process has been approved by Student Life.
            Although it took a bit longer than expected (there were technical issues with deploying the site on
            Chromecasts, but those are fixed now), this
            tremendous project is about to reach maturity!</p>

                        <p>Club Hub's Synchronized Universal Display (SUD) is now out of beta and ready for use. In this
                            update,
                            Club Hub was also repackaged as a distributable framework that anyone can download, install,
                            and
                            use.
                            This new project information page, which replaced the site, is part of the update.</p>
                        <p>IMSA has taken interest in deploying Club Hub for use on its digital poster displays.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Although UX has changed since Club Hub 2.0, the core features remain the same in Club Hub 3.0.0 (minus the
        reminder service, which is under construction). This infographic provides a useful overview of the site.</p>
    <div id="clubhub-intro"><a href="/pages/projects/clubhub/media/introducing_clubhub2.pdf"><img
            src="/pages/projects/clubhub/media/introducing_clubhub2.png"></a></div>

    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p>Club Hub is website that aims to make it easy to find out exactly what's up at IMSA in one swift glance.
        It seeks
        to complement the existing forms of communication--especially the mailing list and facebook page--by
        proving a
        resource that organizes communications beautifully in one place. In the end, Club Hub will help students
        answer
        the question, "What's the Next Big Thing at IMSA?"</p>
    <p>The current sub-goals focus on the current minimum viable product provided by Club Hub: the poster wall.
        These
        goals are to 1) encourage the use of nice and clean posters as visual cues to the
        events/ideas/movements/etc.
        they represent; 2) provide organizational tools to students in order to help them better understand what
        the
        latest thing at IMSA is; and 3) streamline club and campus communications by consolidating the
        information all
        into one format at one accessible place.</p>
    <p>As of August 2016, Club Hub has reached version 3.0.0 and found widespread popularity. It has been adopted as
        IMSA's official event management system. Still, there is room for improvement. Future updates to the system aim
        to include</p>
    <ul class="collection">
        <li class="collection-item">A daily subscribeable email digest of events, replacing the large volume of club
            messages with a single letter
        </li>
        <li class="collection-item">An event reminder system</li>
        <li class="collection-item">Individual, easily managed club pages for each club that can be organized as to
            provide overview
            information
        </li>
        <li class="collection-item">A sync-able Google Calendar of events</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As Club Hub's popularity grows, so will its support base (I might train a team sometime). So stay tuned for
        updates!</p>
