    <p>Club Hub seeks to bring school announcements into the 21st century by
        uploading posters and events to the cloud. Through the magic of automation, it makes admnistrators'
        lives easier by automatically generating event listings and poster slideshows for digital displays.</p>

        <p>I created Club Hub to help reduce information overload when I was a student at the Illinois Math and Science
            Academy. In my first year there, I immediately noticed that our campus-wide mailing list was spammy and
            annoying. Simultaneously, many students found it frustrating to keep track of events and posters when they
            were communicated through Facebook, which was not dedicated to organizing school events (since there is
            significant overlap with personal affairs). To put it shortly, communications at IMSA was heavily fragmented
            and confusing.
        <p>Although I began developing Club Hub as soon as I identified this need, the significant institutional inertia
            and early stage of the project made it difficult for me to convince students to use it. Still, seeing
            its great potential, I iteratively upgraded it whenever I got the time, hoping to build some critical
            feature that would kickstart its widespread adoption.</p>
        <p>Then, disaster struck: a state budget crisis, cripping the monetary resources of our state-funded school. To
            plug expensive ink and paper costs from poster printing, the administration put a hold on all large-format
            poster prints out of our media department. This once-most-popular medium of club communication (students
            would collect these beautiful posters after events to decorate their rooms) was no longer available. As our
            inboxes exploded with ugly emails to compensate, it was
            clear that clubs and faculty needed a new way to communicate events.</p>

        </div>
        <p>That's when Club Hub sprung into the spotlight. Working with the school administration, I deployed three
            digital displays in high-traffic areas and worked to upgrade Club Hub to fit the administration's
            specifications. Since then, Club Hub has enjoyed immense success, and it has become the school's offical
            channel of club communication and event registration.</p>
        <p>Now, I am working to develop Club Hub into a service available to any school that might benefit from it. To

        </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>v0.0.1 beta (September 2014): Club Hub is born! It is very simple prototype&mdash;
            a mere set of static webpages
            each with a Google Calendar and a feed of emails for just that club.
        </li>
        <li>v0.0.2 beta (Winter 2014): The first experiment with a "poster wall" and a management platform (Google
            Sheets, AppScript, and lots of JS).
        </li>
        <li>v0.1.0 beta (Early 2015): Made a standalone poster wall. Beautified the admin sheet. Added a prototype
            auto-slideshow.
        </li>
        <li>v0.2.0 beta: (Spring 2015): Experiments with different aesthetics to try to attract users, including a
            chalkboard aesthetic. It didn't work out, so I returned to minimalism.
        </li>
        <li>v2.0.0 (Winter 2015): Inception of the event table. Added a feature to cast the slideshow on Chromecast.
            This is when I began collaborating with the school administration, putting Club Hub out of beta!
        </li>
        <li>v3.0.1 (July 2016): The modern-day Club Hub, with new aesthetics, admin panel (so long, Sheets!), and robust
            presentation platform.
        </li>
        <li>
            v3.1.0 (Spring and Summer 2017): Since Club Hub's success, I have overhauled Club Hub with bug fixes and
            efficiency improvements to ready it for use by all schools.
