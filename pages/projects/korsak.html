            <p>Everyone likes robots! And everyone likes jazz! So what's not to like about RoboJazz??</p>
            <p>Korsak Ovbot uses machine learning techniques to generate new blippy jam sessions every hour. The purpose
                of this is to explore the concept of "artificial creativity." I believe that some of the catchy tunes it
                creates from time to time shows that robots, too, can be original.</p>
            <p>I submitted this project as the final project in a freshman seminar on Artificial and Natural
                Intelligence with <a href="https://vnmurthylab.org/venkatesh-murthy/" target="_blank">Professor
                    Venkatesh Murthy</a>.
