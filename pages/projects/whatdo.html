            <p>Club Hub goes to college! <b>WhatDo</b> is the next generation of Club Hub for college campuses. Focused
                on answering the age-old question of "What's worth doing today?", WhatDo automatically aggregates events
                from campus event feeds and allows students to vote on, comment, and share the events they love. Just as
                Club Hub seeks to streamline club communications for high schools, WhatDo seeks to package the rich
                abundance of events available in college into a comprehensible format.</p>
