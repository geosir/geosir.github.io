            <p>This was the winner of the MassCEC Cleantech Prize at MakeHarvard 2018.</p>
            <p>In this day, there is a tremendous effort to reduce energy waste by turning off power-consumers (like
                lights) whenever they are unused. However, the best technology for this right now is a motion-activated
                switch. Although it works to quickly turn on when needed, it can also stay on for long periods of time
                after no longer being needed.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Semaphore</b> uses capacitive-sensing technology to intelligently detect when people enter and leave
                its range. For the Makeathon, this capability was demonstrated in a lamp that could switch on when
                people approached, and switch off when they left. Although this is a simple application, the potential
                extensions are tremendous: Street lighting that can adjust its brightness as needed; Traffic lights that
                can cleverly adjust to traffic flow; City sensors that can gather information about activity in an area;
                And of course, smart power switches that can outperform the standard motion-activated switch.
