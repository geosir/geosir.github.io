            <p>Back in 6th grade, I loved to play flash games. Some of my favorite flash games included <i>This
                is the Only Level</i>, <i>Achievement Unlocked</i>, and <i>Llama Adventure</i>, all from
                jmbt02 of Armor Games. Inspired by his prolific and beautiful work, I wondered if I might be
                able to make my own. Although primitive, Click Me was my first excursion into game
                development, in which I learned to use ActionScript (similar to JavaScript) to compile and
                embed flash games on my home webserver.</p>
            <p>Unfortuneately, Flash quickly fell out of favor shortly after I made the first draft of the
                game (nowadays, I'm learning to use modern frameworks, like Unity). However, developing and
                embedding this game, especially with its JS-like syntax, helped introduce me to web
                development very early on as I entered junior high.</p>

            <p>During the summer of 2015, I worked on a research project at the University of Illinois at
                Chicago (UIC) Artifical Intelligence Lab. Our goal was to develop an intelligent agent
                embued with a "theory of mind." <b>Theory of Mind</b> is an important human ability to
                imagine what others are thinking as one observes and interacts with another. Examples
                include keeping track of comprehension during a conversation, understanding unspoken queues
                and reading into subtext, or playing a competitive game.
            </p>
            <p>The result, progammed in Java and
                Lisp, was <b>MARTHA</b>, the <b>M</b>ental-state <b>A</b>ware <b>R</b>eal-time <b>TH</b>inking
                <b>A</b>ssistant, which, with further development, could compete with popular AI assistants
                like Siri and Google Now with its deep understanding of user desires. We wrote a paper
                describing its Theory of
                Mind algorithm, which we published in the proceedings of the 2015 AAAI Fall Symposia Series.
                Since it was accepted, I had the opportunity to travel to Arlington, Virgina to present my

            <p>Mark OvBot uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov Chains</a> to
                model language and generate proper-sounding sentences. In the beginning, I trained Mark with
                curated corpuses, but I needed much more data in order to make it truely sophisticated. The
                next source was Twitter, but the content was choppy and full of links and emoji. Now, I am
                working on plugging Mark into news feeds so that it can learn from large edited bodies of
                proper english.</p>
            <p>Mark differs from a naive implementations of Markov chatbots in that I've implemented a
                relevancy function into its code. Each time it generates a response, it creates a large
                number of candidate sentences. These are rated on how relevant the constituent words are to
                the seed query, and the highest rated response is the one that is presented to the user.</p>
            <p>Mark is currently under testing in the wild. However, the content has been learned from
                unfiltered
                Tweets, such that it is not safe to link from this website.</p>

            <p>Even in the driest deserts, there are vast amounts of water scattered in the air as water
                vapor. Anyone who’s had a ice cold drink in drier climates has experienced this through the
                condensation that appears on the glass.</p>
            <p>HydroHero uses water condensation technology to extract this water from the air. As a
                personal water generator presented in one easy-to-use package, it seeks to provide
                peace-of-mind to those afflicted by a natural disaster or living in remote (or distitute)
                areas where there may not be electricity, gas, nor a central water supply.</p>
            <p>Its principle of operation is intentionally simple: using solar energy, a fan draws
                water-laden air through a particulate filter (to remove dust) and into an array of fins
                chilled by a peltier tile. Meeting a surface cooler than the dew point, the water condenses
                into droplets, which then roll down the smooth surface of the fins, into a collecting
                funnel. From there, it exits the apparatus and accumulates in the collecting bin.</p>
            <p>I've begun to experiment with prototypes built from common computer parts (a heatsink and a
                fan) and cheap Peltier tiles. In my early tests, I was able to see condensation appearing on
                the fins of a smaller heatsink! But to drive the large heatsink shown, I figure that I'll
                need more peltier tiles, and more energy.</p>
            <p>Where there is water, there is life. HydroHero seeks to improve life by giving water to the

            <p>It is unnerving that Comcast holds a virtual monopoly over internet service in my area. Not
                only does the entire neighborhood suffer when there is an outage, due to the lack of
                competition, they have no barrier against charging exorbitant prices and providing poor
                service.</p>
            <p>So I wondered, could there be a way to create a high-availability network that puts control
                of the internet into the hands of the people who frequent it, instead of the backbone
                providers? That's when IKEN was born, an idea place nodes in a "mesh network" with many
                possible routes from one node to another. This way, no one entity can control the internet,
                nor does a failure at one node result in a catastrophic failure systemwide.</p>
            <p>I intend to test this as a messaging system locally at my school, which is why it's called
                the IMSA Knowledge Exchange Network.</p>

            <p>SCAINET started even before I had the idea to build it for IMSA. Around middle school, my
                parents' companies were downsizing/renewing their assets, so we got ahold of a couple of old
                desktops and servers for free (the same ones that now run Mark). Sure, they were fun to play
                with individually, but there were so many of them...I began to wonder if there was a way to
                combine their power. Back then, the frameworks available to the enthusiast were fairly
                primitive, but I got as far as writing a parallel C++ program with OpenMPI to (slowly and
                less efficiently) factor numbers.</p>
            <p>Fast forward to 2014, my sophomore year and my first year at IMSA. I learned that there were
                a large number of modern laptops up for retirement soon, so I inquired with our IT services
                if I might acquire them. I did, and I put them together to make SCAINET. With the explosion
                of "cloud computing" in about 2012, there were now plenty of clustering frameworks,
                including <a href="http://dispy.sourceforge.net/">dispy</a>. With SCAINET, I rendered a
                10000x10000px Mandelbrot set, helped peers generete 3D art and animations, and crunched
                through student simulations for their SIR projects. I am now upgrading SCAINET to become a
                more permanent and modular appliance for the school.</p>

            <p>This is my first custom-built desktop! I handpicked the parts after extensive research on a
                budget of $1,000...cheaper than my school laptop. I optimized it for computational speed
                (fast CPU, fast RAM, and fast Disk I/O) to suit my programming and computer modeling needs,
                but did not overlook grabbing a graphics card for when I do want to play a few games.</p>

            <p>TesserStats is a temparture indicator I made for my custom-built desktop. It uses the same
                matrix
                display driver I made for GeoMatrix. It's satisfying to see that feedback when I'm pushing
                my computer hard (during intense scientific simulations, for instance), or to see cool it
                runs even when playing graphically involved games. It used to have a beeping alarm for when
                it reached critical temperatures, but it fell off and rolled somewhere :(.</p>

            <p>This was my one of my first experiments in Arduino programming. With simple electronics I had
                laying around (as well as some paper), I set up this Arduino to drive this homemade matrix
                display. The test program generated falling strings of light across the display, much like
                the falling strings of text seen in the Matrix.</p>
