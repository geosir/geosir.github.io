            <p>The Illinois Math and Science Academy uses PowerSchool for its Student Information System.
                One of its uses is to let students know what their course schedule will be for the following
                academic year. Unfortuneately, this exists as a indecipherable series of codes specifying
                days and periods&mdash;easy for a computer to understand, but hard for a student to visualize. My
                <b>New Schedule Machine</b> (much improved from the old one) allows
                students to enter data from PowerSchool to generate colorful and organized bell schedules,
                making sharing schedulesa and finding classes on day one significantly easier.</p>
