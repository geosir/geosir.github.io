                <b>Unitopia</b> was my final project for US-WORLD 29 "Designing the American City: Civic Aspirations
                and Urban Form," a course I took at Harvard that examined the history of urban spaces in America and
                how the those spaces evolved with the needs and dreams of its inhabitants. For my final project, I
                wanted to apply those analytical tools to dig into the phenomenon of college towns, in particular,
                the city around Harvard/MIT, which I saw as one of the most extreme examples of influential
                institutions working in tandem with local residents.

                In Unitopia, I combine publicly available civic property data with a researched history of the area
                to tell the story of how Cambridge, MA grew with its nexus of higher education, making observations of
                interesting patterns, connecting them with historical causes, and speculating about what they mean
                for future trends.
