                <b>Troav</b> is a startup I co-founded which seeks to employ engineering thinking and modern
                algorithms to bring the sharing economy to physical goods, like tech products, fashion, recreational
                equipment, and utilities. We are working to change consumers' relationships with the items they use in
                a way that promotes exploration and reduces waste. The current iteration lets users subscribe to a
                membership that lets them access all the items in our inventory at their convenience, thereby
                reducing barriers to discover the items that make their lives better and enable them to do more.
            </p>
            <p>
                A crucial part of the project is developing the technology and infrastructure to support the service.
                Currently, we are working on engineered solutions to challenges such as cheaper delivery and
                smart asset security.
