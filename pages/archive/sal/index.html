	<h1>Go for Moe! for Senior-at-Large</h1>
	<p>StudCo is the voice of the students...but why has it been so quiet? There's still tons of important work happening, but it's not being communicated very well. It's about time that StudCo becomes a more accessible resource for the student body. And I have a plan to make that happen.</p>
	<h1>A Plan for a More Open StudCo</h1>
	<h2 style="clear: both">Get Informed Regularly</h2>
	<img align="left" style="border: none; width: 10%; margin: 0 3% 3% 3%" src="/pages/sal/media/informed.png" />
	<p>It's hard to find out what's going on with StudCo's latest projects. That's why I will personally ensure that StudCo issues regular updates in the form of friendly newsletters, videos, and infographics--putting information in YOUR hands so that you can be a more informed resident at the Academy.</p>

	<h2 style="clear: both">Stand Together at Class Talks</h2>
	<img align="left" style="border: none; width: 10%; margin: 0 3% 3% 3%" src="/pages/sal/media/classtalks.png" />
	<p>We're very close as a class, and we've seen that even with small "class talks" on specific issues (such as mental health), we've said and heard some profound truths about life at IMSA, the modern student, and the future beyond. I plan to make these class talks a more frequent and anticipated event--a time of friendship and learning the class comes together to discuss the state of the Academy.</p>
	<h2 style="clear: both">Take Action with Student Action Committees</h2>
	<img align="left" style="border: none; width: 10%; margin: 0 3% 3% 3%" src="/pages/sal/media/sac.png" />
	<p>As rising seniors, we're taking on roles as leaders in the IMSA community. We've seen what IMSA's all about, its gifts and also its flaws--so as students, we already know a lot about improving IMSA! StudCo should be your resource for being the change you want to see. Introducing the Student Action Committee, StudCo projects proposed by students, led by students, and run for the students. I will work to establish the groundwork for these so that come next year, you can lead your own project at the Academy.</p>
	<h2 style="clear: both">Trust Experience</h2>
	<img align="left" style="border: none; width: 10%; margin: 0 3% 3% 3%" src="/pages/sal/media/experience.png" />
	<p>As a veteran StudCo member, I have experience in working with administrators and partners to make sure important StudCo projects are possible. Take Club Hub for example--aside from dedicating time and effort to code the framework, the project required working with Student Life, ITS, ITMC, and the Innovation Department to make sure it would be logistically successful. It takes time, skill, and effort to push changes which benefit everyone.</p>
